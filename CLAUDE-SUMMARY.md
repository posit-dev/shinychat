Perfect! The build completed successfully. I've successfully implemented a custom Lit
  directive that solves the streaming markdown DOM update problem. Here's what I created:

  Solution Summary

  I created a streaming markdown directive (streaming-markdown-directive.ts) that:

  1. Tracks content state - Maintains the last processed content and HTML to detect changes
  2. Uses morphdom for minimal updates - Only updates DOM nodes that actually changed rather
  than replacing the entire content
  3. Preserves user interactions - Maintains focus states and caret positions in input
  elements
  4. Optimizes for streaming - Only processes new chunks when content is appended

  Key Features

  - Minimal DOM updates: Uses morphdom to diff and patch only changed elements
  - State preservation: Preserves focus, selection, and user interaction state
  - Streaming-aware: Only re-renders when content actually changes or grows
  - Type-safe: Full TypeScript support with proper type annotations
  - Memory efficient: Reuses existing DOM nodes instead of creating new ones

  Integration

  The MarkdownElement class now:
  - Uses the streaming directive when streaming=true and content type is
  markdown/semi-markdown
  - Falls back to the original unsafeHTML approach for non-streaming scenarios
  - Maintains all existing functionality while providing better streaming performance

  The solution ensures that when markdown content is being streamed chunk by chunk, only the
  new or changed parts of the DOM are updated, preventing the flickering and state loss that
  occurred with full re-renders.i
